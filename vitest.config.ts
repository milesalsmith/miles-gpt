 * Vitest config for the Stage 1 testing framework.

 * - Unit tests live in `test/unit/**` and run in plain Node — they're for
 *   pure-logic helpers and shouldn't pay the workerd startup cost.
 * - Integration tests live in `test/integration/**` and run inside a real
 *   `workerd` via @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers, with our DO + SQLite +
 *   D1 + AI bindings from wrangler.jsonc.
 *
 * Workers AI is faked by default. To opt into the real binding, set
 * USE_REAL_AI=1 and run `npm run test:live`.
